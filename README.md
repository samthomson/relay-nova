## About

Relay Nova was largely vibed with [Shakespeare](https://shakespeare.diy) (Claude Sonnet + GLM 4.5) and [MKStack](https://soapbox.pub/mkstack), then worked on locally with Cursor + Sonnet 3.5-4.5.

## Data Sources

- **Relay Data**: Initially sourced from [Nostr Watch](https://nostr.watch/relays), then geo-coded to provide global visualization
- **Radio Streams**: Sourced from the [radio-browser](https://www.radio-browser.info/) project
